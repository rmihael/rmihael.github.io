My name is Michael Korbakov. I'm a software developer and an architect with passion about technology, mathematics and formal methods in software development. My current research interest is digging into functional programming paradigm and applying it to everyday software engineering problems. The project that currently keeps me busy is [Nimble CRM](http://nimble.com) -- a platform for social selling with great vision behind it.

Before starting my career in software engineering industry I spent few years at Space Research Institute in Kiev, Ukraine. At that time I was doing all sorts of things starting from designing and rack-mounting Infiniband HPC clusters to training neural networks for satellite imagery processing to building widely distributed GRID services. That was cool experience, but I decided to take other route for more fun and profit.
